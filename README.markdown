This the my personal site hosted on GitHub.
There is no good reason to have a web server for this site, so this static hosting is perfect.

The way GH hosting works, 
it serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch.
So I keep all of the source on the `main` branch.

## Writing posts

1. Make a new file in content.
2. Create a webserver.
3. Build the content and preview it.
4. Edit, rebuild.

Repeat step 4, as necessary.

Finally, commit & push to Github `main` branch.
The github action will deploy the site.
