Title: Developing Python on Vertica

Vertica is a very powerful analytics database,
and we can easily extend functionality now by building in Python functions.
This is great and all,
so here I'll focus on setting up a development environment for building a simple UDx.

The [documentation from Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/ExtendingVertica/UDx/DevEnvironment.htm) is not super specific, so this may help!

For the local setup, we'll be using https://github.com/jbfavre/docker-vertica/.
I'm going to focus on the CentOS version, since it is most similar to Amazon's RHEL images.
To get started (on OSX, you need the Docker client first):

```bash
docker pull jbfavre/vertica:9.2.0-7_centos-7
```

Also take a second to get [Python 3.5.1 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/).
Those are the two steps that require the most bandwidth!

Now, run that thing:

```bash
docker run -p 5433:5433 jbfavre/vertica:9.2.0-7_centos-7
```

Grab the name of the running container from `docker ps` command, and set it to `$DOCKER_NAME`, and copy in our Python source:

```bash
DOCKER_NAME=suspicious_chatelet
docker cp Downloads/Python-3.5.1.tgz $DOCKER_NAME:/home/dbadmin/
```

Phew! We're done with the parts that are specific to a local setup.
If you're working on a server somewhere, copy up the `Python-3.5.1.tgz`
and put it at `/home/dbadmin/Python-3.5.1.tgz`.
For good measure (i.e., if you copied with the root user) make sure it's owned by `dbadmin`:

```bash
chown dbadmin /home/dbadmin/Python-3.5.1.tgz
```

As root,
install all of the dependencies that you need for Python.
WARNING: these may not be everything that YOU need
(see alternative dependencies in an install like [this](https://gist.github.com/Sunlighter/87bbd2cd80971c7c0d4763ec1b5ea548))
or rely on the `python3` that is available with the `yum` installer directly.

```bash
yum install openssl-devel bzip2-devel expat-devel gdbm-devel readline-devel sqlite-devel
```

Grab a coffee.

Switch to `dbadmin` user and do:

```bash
cd /home/dbadmin/Python-3.5.1
./configure
make
make install
```

Probably another coffee for that one!

If you run the above as `dbadmin`, which you should, skip the `make install` line.
Or only do that last line as `root`.

Maybe still as root, though again this should be fine (and preferable) as dbadmin user in the `/home/dbadmin` directory. If you used root for anything above other than `make install`, you might need to keep `root` user active. Here goes:

```bash
Python-3.5.1/python -m venv pyenv
pyenv/bin/pip install -U pip
pyenv/bin/pip install requirements.txt
```

If you're within a firewall, you might need `--index-url=[your company's artifactory]` for the pip install lines.
What is the `requirements.txt` line? All of the packages that your function needs,
just like the requirements file from any python package.

Finally you should be able to execute the SQL needed to build your function!
Put your code in `myfunction.py` and then you can run `vsql` as dbadmin, and do:

```bash
\set libfile '\''`pwd`'/myfunction.py\''
DROP LIBRARY mylib CASCADE;

CREATE LIBRARY mylib AS :libfile DEPENDS '/home/dbadmin/pyenv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/' LANGUAGE 'Python';
CREATE FUNCTION myfunction AS NAME 'myfunction_factory' LIBRARY mylib;
```

If you run into permissions issues having done all of the Python stuff as `root`,
you can get the function to build by opening up the virtual environment permissions
using these commands (as `root` in `/home/dbadmin`):

```bash
find pyenv -type f -exec chmod 666 {} \;
find . -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
```

Cheers!
I could build the python3 and package that into a Docker based off the original,
but that would be less fun for you.
