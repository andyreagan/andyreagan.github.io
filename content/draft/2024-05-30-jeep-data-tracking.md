Through a trending discussion on HN,
I learned that some companies give police location data without a warrant.
Including the parent company of a vehicle we recently got.
WAIT - HOW DO THEY HAVE MY LOCATION DATA?

Turns out - the GPS used for Nav and the 4G attennae that can act as a hotspot "phone home" my location data to the dealer.
Being in the data space,
and being protective of my own data,
I haven't been personally worried like this before.
Google is reading my emails to serve ads, sure.
Presumably they're not evil.
But the location data feels like a step too far!

In the same thread,
Jeep owners shared a few links on how to remove them.
Another win for the DIY jeep community.
Here are the links I found:
